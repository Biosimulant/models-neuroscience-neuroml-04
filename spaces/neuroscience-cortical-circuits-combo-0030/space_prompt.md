# Space Prompt - neuroscience-cortical-circuits-combo-0030

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / cortical_circuits** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-neuroml-layer-6-continuous-irregular-nest-basket-cell-3-nmlcl000749-model, neuroscience-neuroml-layer-6-continuous-irregular-nest-basket-cell-4-nmlcl000750-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
